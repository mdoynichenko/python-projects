# My minor python projects and scripts

$\textbf{1. approximation01.py}$

  It builds a numerical solution for differential equation




$\textbf{2. approximation02.py}$

  It builds a numerical solution for differential equation (and compares it with analytical solution) using following numerical methods:
  
  1. Trapezoidal rule
  
  2. Heun's method
  
  3. Midpoint method
  
  4. Runge–Kutta method
 
$\textbf{3. spral_matrix.py}$
  It builds matrix with size m*n filled in form of spiral. Input parametrs: m, n. Returns matrix.
